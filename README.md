_A basic example of the **MVC pattern in PHP**, featuring database integration, user registration, and login functionalities._

```
MVC-Simple-Example/
|-- controller/
|   |-- mainController.php
|   |-- productController.php
|   |-- userController.php
|
|-- model/
|   |-- user.php
|   |-- database.php
|
|-- public/
|   |-- assets/
|   |   |-- ... (CSS, JS, images, etc.)
|   |-- index.php
|
|-- view/
|   |-- header.php
|   |-- home.php
|   |-- footer.php
|   |-- login.php
|   |-- register.php
|
|-- errors/
|   |-- ErrorHandler.php
|   |-- NotFoundException.php
|   |-- DatabaseException.php
|   |-- 404.php
|   |-- database_error.php
|   |-- error.php
|
|-- .env
|-- ... (any other configurations or utility files you might have)

```
### **controller/**:

- **mainController**: Manages requests related to the main pages of your application.
- **productController**: Deals with product-related requests like adding, updating, viewing, or deleting products.
- **userController**: Handles user-related requests such as sign-up, login, logout, and profile viewing.

### model/:
- **user.php**: Contains the business logic and functions related to users, such as retrieving, saving, or updating user information.

### public/:
- **assets/**: Houses static resources like images, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript scripts.
- **index.php**: The main entry point for your application. It initializes and routes requests to the appropriate controllers.

### view/:
- **header**: The common header to display across multiple pages.
- **home**: The main view or homepage of your application.
- **login and register**: Views for user login and sign-up.

### errors/: 
- A dedicated **directory for error handling**. It contains both the error handling classes and the views associated with specific error types.

### .env:
- Contains your application's environment variables and configurations. This might include details like database connection info, API keys, and other environment-specific configurations.
